/**
 Older Than Me
Create a method in the Person class which returns how another person's age compares. Given the instances p1, p2 and p3, which will be initialised with the attributes name and age, return a sentence in the following format:

{other person name} is {older than / younger than / the same age as} me.

Examples
p1 = Person("Samuel", 24)
p2 = Person("Joel", 36)
p3 = Person("Lily", 24)
p1.compareAge(p2) ➞ "Joel is older than me."

p2.compareAge(p1) ➞ "Samuel is younger than me."

p1.compareAge(p3) ➞ "Lily is the same age as me."
